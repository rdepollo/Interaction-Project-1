Seeing Sounds
Created by Rob DePollo
CCS Winter 2018

This project was an attempt to recontextualize my collection of music equipment for the web. I created motion graphics that are intended to illustrate my subjective understanding of how these different pieces of equipment make and alter sounds. These graphics are presented in a flow-chart format to give the viewer an undestanding of how these pieces of equipment relate to one another within the process of creating music.
